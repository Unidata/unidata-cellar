# Welcome to the NSF Unidata Cellar

The NSF Unidata Cellar is a repository intended to host code and code-related assets (such as scripts, notebooks, and IDV bundles) that accompany [NSF Unidata blog posts](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/news).

## Functionality and Maintenance

Material in this repository is expected to be fully functional at the time of its associated blog post publication.
Given the variety of materials contained within this repository, we do not have formal, proactive testing in place.
We encourage users to report any broken material via GitHub issues, and would be thrilled to receive pull requests with fixes!
